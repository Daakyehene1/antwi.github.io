<h1 style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.jw.org">The Blood</a></h1>

<p id="para1">You have all one way or the other visited the lab or have had a cut<br> if not has seen blood before.<br> How does it look like?<br>
It is estimated about 70% of what makes <strong>you</strong> is blood and this blood is in a liquid state.<br>
Simply put <u>blood</u> is the reddish liquid that is found in your body.<br>
So with this definition in mind any reddish-like liquid that comes out of the body is called <em>blood</em>.
<br> Now what is inside the blood? A big question!
</p>
<h2>Types of blood</h2>
<p>
As i said earlier the visible color of the blood is red la la la.Why? the answer is simple because red is dominant.<br>
Can you recall when you visisted the lab for malaria text? What actually happenend?<br> How was the technician able to know you're anemic?
<br> OKay i will tell you mine a drop of your blood was taken and immediately there was a tube to collect the drop.<br>
There was a machine, yes a Centrifuge and the process is called Centrifugation.<br>
Centrifugation is the process in which mixtures are seperated using the centripetal force generated by spinning in centrifuge.<br>
I hope you remember blood is also a mixture, as we proceed you will get to know.<br>
After the process you will see a <strong>three layers<strong> ranging from less dense to a more dense material.<br>
So there is a liquid and a cellular part of the blood.<br> We gonna look at it one after the other.<br> Gradually w are moving.
The types are:
<ol>
<li> Plasma</li>
<li>White Blood Cell</li>
<li>Red Blood Cell</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">The Plasma</h3>
<p>
From the order above the blood plasma is the less dense portion of the blood which covers about 55% of the blood.<br>
Guess what? 90% of the plasma is water lol. It's interesting right ?<br> Because 55% of the blood is plasma ans 90% of the plama
is water.<br>
That's why we always entreat you to drink more water.<br>
So we have gptten 90% right, what is the rest 10% made up for?<br>
It is made up of a very essential material called protein namely:<br>
<ul>
<li> Fibrinogens( clotting factors)</li>
<li>Albumin</li>
<li>Antibodies</li>
</ul>
The remaining 2% is made fo of other things like insulin, glucose ,and other nutrient like sodium.
Apart from the <em>Fibrinogens</em> all the proteins which falls in the 8% is the <strong>Serum</strong>.
</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center">White Blood Cell(WBC)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com">The WBC is about 1% of the blood volume.</a></p>
